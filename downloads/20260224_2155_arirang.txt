Welcome to Arirang News. This is Key Kim. We start with the top headlines at this hour. 1. Speaking at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Lee praised Team Korea's determination and resilience. He also called for measures to make it easier for the public to watch such international sporting events, noting that this year's Olympics did not generate the level of nationwide excitement seen in the past. Lee's remarks appeared to refer to cable network JTBC's exclusive domestic broadcast of the Games. JTBC secured broadcast rights for the Olympics from 2026 through 2032 from the International Olympic Committee in 2019. However, negotiations to sublicense coverage to other Korean broadcasters ultimately collapsed, reportedly due to the high costs. 2. South Korea’s National Assembly is heading into what could be its longest plenary session, after an opposition-led filibuster was triggered by a series of controversial bills backed by the ruling party. During Tuesday's session, lawmakers first voted to approve the arrest of former Democratic Party lawmaker Kang Sun-woo, who is accused of accepting illegal campaign donations. The ruling party then introduced revisions to the Commercial Act, along with three judicial reform bills that would expand the Supreme Court, establish a new appeals system, and penalize officials accused of distorting legal rulings. As soon as the revision to the Commercial Act was reported to the floor, the People Power Party launched a filibuster --- with eight bills remaining on the agenda. The plenary session came just hours after the Legislation and Judiciary Committee approved a special act on administrative integration for Jeollanam-do Province and Gwangju, led by the ruling Democratic Party. The selective passage drew sharp criticism from the People Power Party, which said it does not oppose administrative integration in principle but accused the ruling party of fast-tracking bills for politically favorable regions without clear standards, including fiscal support. The Democratic Party pushed back, accusing the opposition of holding the bills hostage through filibusters and blocking regional development, while parliamentary rules mean only one bill can be processed per day due to the 24-hour waiting period to end debate. 3. Presidential chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik has departed for the UAE to discuss cooperation on AI and the defense industry. He's set to discuss follow-ups to last year's summit between President Lee Jae Myung and his UAE counterpart Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The two countries are reportedly looking for a possible joint development of a weapons system to expand arms cooperation beyond exports. It's Kang's third visit to Abu Dhabi as a special presidential envoy for strategic economic cooperation. 4. Starting at 12:01 AM Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time, U.S. President Donald Trump's new "global tariff" officially took effect at a 10 percent rate on most imports from around the world. This is 5 percentage points below the 15 percent rate President Trump announced over the weekend for all trading partners. Following a proclamation signed late last week under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, the provision authorizes the president to impose temporary surcharges of up to 15 percent for a maximum of 150 days to address serious U.S. trade deficits or balance of payments imbalances, without prior approval from Congress. Trump's move came as a direct response to last Friday's Supreme Court decision, which struck down many of his earlier "reciprocal" and country-specific tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, ruling that the president had exceeded his authority. Just hours before the imposition of 15 percent tariff, U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued guidance to importers confirming the initial 10 percent rate applies for now. The global tariff does not apply to certain critical categories such as energy products, pharmaceuticals, and key agricultural goods, among others. In response, China's Ministry of Commerce has urged the U.S. to revoke unilateral tariff measures and refrain from imposing new ones, while expressing willingness to engage in candid consultations during the upcoming sixth round of economic and trade talks between the two countries. 5. Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, has been promoted from vice director of a department to the head of an undisclosed department at the ruling Workers' Party. According to North Korea's state-run Korea Central News Agency on Tuesday, the decision was made on Monday, the fifth day of the ninth Workers' Party Congress. Kim Yo-jong was also reinstated as an alternate member of the Politburo, the Party's highest policymaking body, after having been demoted to an ordinary Central Committee member five years ago. The KCNA also announced the five members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the regime's highest decision-making body when plenary meetings of the Party's Central Committee are not in session. Remarks by Kim Jong-un from Monday's meeting, where he said that no challenge or change in circumstances would be able to slow or stop the North's advance, were also reported.
