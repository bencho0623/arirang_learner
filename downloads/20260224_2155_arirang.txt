President Lee Jae Myung has called for a faster legislation process in the face of a changing global order. Speaking at a Cabinet meeting this morning, Lee said he sees it difficult to actively deal with changes in the global order with lawmaking "at current speed." He added that South Korea is facing high global instability and fierce competition,... and called for national unity. The president noted that the country is in dire need of laws to carry out trade deals with foreign nations and push ahead with regulatory reform. 2. Also on Tuesday, the Cabinet approved that highway tolls will be free of charge during the Lunar New Year holiday next week. Toll fees will be exempt nationwide from February 15th to the 18th. The temporary exemption is aimed at easing people's transportation cost burdens. The transport ministry expects more than 27-million people to travel across the nation during the holiday. 3. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi thanked... President Lee Jae Myung... for his online post of congratulations on her party's recent victory in the Lower House snap election. On Monday evening, the Japanese leader took to her social media platform to sincerely thank him both in Japanese and Korean. She also wrote that Seoul and Tokyo are important neighbors... who must cooperate on the many challenges... facing the international community. She further made note... of President Lee's visit to her home prefecture of Nara last month... adding hopes to visit South Korea in the near future. 4. South Korea has finalized its medical school quota increase after a prolonged dispute since 2024. The government has put forth a five-year plan to increase medical school admissions starting from the 2027 academic year to address regional and public healthcare shortages. Following a meeting by the Health and Medical Policy Deliberation Committee on Tuesday, the Health Ministry says that enrollment will, on average, increase by 668 students per year from 2027 to 2031,... adding up to a total of 3,342 students over the next five years. The government is emphasizing that it's a gradual increase to avoid strain on medical education. All additional places will be allocated to 32 medical schools outside the capital region and will supplement the regional doctor track, which requires graduates to work in their hometown for 10 years in an effort to strengthen local and essential healthcare services. The Ministry said it will provide full support through residency and regional settlement. Compared to the previous administration's plan to add 2-thousand students annually over five years starting in 2024, the scale of the current expansion has been reduced to roughly one-third of that. The Korean Medical Association criticized the plan immediately during an emergency press conference. It argued that the government's workforce projections lacked a basis. 5. According to the Ministry of Science and ICT on Tuesday, the names and email addresses of 33.67 million users had been leaked from the company’s system, which is far more than the initially reported number of 4,500. Officials warned that the actual number of victims could be even higher, as Coupang users often register delivery details for family members and acquaintances. According to the joint public-private investigation team, attackers gained access to Coupang’s servers by exploiting vulnerabilities in its authentication system, and were able to bypass normal security procedures by forging digital access passes. However, authorities did not officially disclose the identity of the suspect, and key details including the exact scale of the data leak with the Personal Information Protection Commission expected to release further findings at a later date. Meanwhile, the investigation team said no secondary damage resulting from the breach has been confirmed so far. According to the ministry, Coupang will be fined for its delayed reporting and placed under formal investigation for failing to preserve key evidence, despite earlier government requests. Under South Korean law, such delays are punishable by fines of up to 30 million won, or approximately 20 thousand U.S. dollars. Moving to weather forecast, In the mountainous areas of Jejudo Island, where a heavy snow advisory has been issued, everything is already covered in fresh white snow. Until tomorrow morning, about 5 to 15 millimeters of rain is expected. In colder areas, that rain will likely turn into snow. In the meantime, eastern areas will not get much precipitation, so dry conditions will continue. Most areas will start off above freezing temperatures with Seoul and Gwangju at 1 degree. 59:30’ The current temperatures are: _______ degrees in Seoul _______ degrees in Pyeongchang _______ degrees in Busan And _______ degrees on Jejudo Island 59:39’ You’re listening to Arirang Radio 59:42’ 5883 2026-02-25 Podcast Play 13:55 Arirang News Welcome to Arirang News This is Park Kee hoon And we start with the top headlines at this hour. 1. South Korea’s benchmark KOSPI opened higher Wednesday, breaking new historic landmark of 6,000 amid an extended rally in technology stocks. The KOSPI opened at 6-thousand-22-point-7-0, up 53-point-0-6 points, or 0-point-8-9 percent, from the previous day. On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics and SK hynix closed above the 200,000 won and 1 million won marks, respectively, pushing up the index. 2. South Korean Ambassador to the United States Kang Kyung-wha says Seoul will actively work with Washington to ensure trade discussions proceed in a "friendly atmosphere." Speaking to correspondents in Washington on Tuesday local time, Kang addressed the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling that declared reciprocal tariffs illegal, and the Trump administration's subsequent move to levy new global tariffs. She emphasized that the embassy is closely monitoring the Trump administration's follow-up measures including additional tariffs to protect South Korean interests. On the security front, Seoul and Washington are continuing discussions on implementing their "Joint Fact Sheet," which covers cooperation on nuclear-powered submarines and nuclear energy. 3. The Commander of U.S. Forces Korea has expressed regret to Seoul's Defense Minister for not briefing him promptly on recent air drills over the Yellow Sea. In a statement Tuesday, General Xavier Brunson said he spoke with Minister Ahn Gyu-back to clarify that notification was provided at a working level, but regretted that the Minister and the JCS Chairman were not briefed in time. This follows a rare standoff last week when Chinese fighter jets were dispatched in response to some 10 USFK F-16s flying between the air defense identification zones of South Korea and China. Following a complaint from Seoul about the lack of advance notice, the U.S. military ended the exercise on Thursday, two days earlier than planned. Local media reported that USFK apologized for the incident, but USFK denied the report, emphasizing it does not make apologies for maintaining readiness. 4. The White House says diplomacy is President Donald Trump's first option in dealing with Iran, but stressed that he's prepared to use lethal military force if necessary. According to the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday, President Trump is the final decision maker and will act if talks fail. The U.S. has deployed significant naval forces near Iran’s coast, as Trump last week gave Tehran roughly 10 to 15 days to reach a deal. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to brief congressional leaders known as the Gang of Eight at the White House on the Iran situation. 5. South Korea’s National Assembly is heading into what could be its longest plenary session, after an opposition-led filibuster was triggered by a series of controversial bills backed by the ruling party. During Tuesday's session, lawmakers first voted to approve the arrest of former Democratic Party lawmaker Kang Sun-woo, who is accused of accepting illegal campaign donations. The ruling party then introduced revisions to the Commercial Act, along with three judicial reform bills that would expand the Supreme Court, establish a new appeals system, and penalize officials accused of distorting legal rulings. As soon as the revision to the Commercial Act was reported to the floor, the People Power Party launched a filibuster with eight bills remaining on the agenda. 5882 2026-02-25 Podcast Play 10:55 Arirang News Welcome to Arirang News This is Park Kee hoon And we start with the top headlines at this hour. 1.

Four years after launching its invasion of Ukraine, Russia said Tuesday that it will continue fighting until it fully achieves its objectives. Moscow maintains it's open to a peaceful resolution, but insists any progress depends entirely on Kyiv’s actions. The Kremlin is again demanding that Ukraine give up the Donbas region, making clear there will be no compromise on territorial issues. President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of obstructing peace negotiations and warned there would be consequences for any nuclear strike against Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pushed back, saying Ukraine has defended its independence for four years and that Putin has failed to win the war. He also urged Europe to step up pressure on Russia. 5881 2026-02-24 Podcast Play 21:55 Arirang News Welcome to Arirang News. This is Key Kim. We start with the top headlines at this hour. 1. Speaking at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Lee praised Team Korea's determination and resilience. He also called for measures to make it easier for the public to watch such international sporting events, noting that this year's Olympics did not generate the level of nationwide excitement seen in the past. Lee's remarks appeared to refer to cable network JTBC's exclusive domestic broadcast of the Games. JTBC secured broadcast rights for the Olympics from 2026 through 2032 from the International Olympic Committee in 2019. However, negotiations to sublicense coverage to other Korean broadcasters ultimately collapsed, reportedly due to the high costs. 2. South Korea’s National Assembly is heading into what could be its longest plenary session, after an opposition-led filibuster was triggered by a series of controversial bills backed by the ruling party. During Tuesday's session, lawmakers first voted to approve the arrest of former Democratic Party lawmaker Kang Sun-woo, who is accused of accepting illegal campaign donations. The ruling party then introduced revisions to the Commercial Act, along with three judicial reform bills that would expand the Supreme Court, establish a new appeals system, and penalize officials accused of distorting legal rulings. As soon as the revision to the Commercial Act was reported to the floor, the People Power Party launched a filibuster --- with eight bills remaining on the agenda. The plenary session came just hours after the Legislation and Judiciary Committee approved a special act on administrative integration for Jeollanam-do Province and Gwangju, led by the ruling Democratic Party. The selective passage drew sharp criticism from the People Power Party, which said it does not oppose administrative integration in principle but accused the ruling party of fast-tracking bills for politically favorable regions without clear standards, including fiscal support. The Democratic Party pushed back, accusing the opposition of holding the bills hostage through filibusters and blocking regional development, while parliamentary rules mean only one bill can be processed per day due to the 24-hour waiting period to end debate. 3. Presidential chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik has departed for the UAE to discuss cooperation on AI and the defense industry. He's set to discuss follow-ups to last year's summit between President Lee Jae Myung and his UAE counterpart Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The two countries are reportedly looking for a possible joint development of a weapons system to expand arms cooperation beyond exports. It's Kang's third visit to Abu Dhabi as a special presidential envoy for strategic economic cooperation. 4. Starting at 12:01 AM Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time, U.S. President Donald Trump's new "global tariff" officially took effect at a 10 percent rate on most imports from around the world. This is 5 percentage points below the 15 percent rate President Trump announced over the weekend for all trading partners. Following a proclamation signed late last week under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, the provision authorizes the president to impose temporary surcharges of up to 15 percent for a maximum of 150 days to address serious U.S. trade deficits or balance of payments imbalances, without prior approval from Congress. Trump's move came as a direct response to last Friday's Supreme Court decision, which struck down many of his earlier "reciprocal" and country-specific tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, ruling that the president had exceeded his authority. Just hours before the imposition of 15 percent tariff, U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued guidance to importers confirming the initial 10 percent rate applies for now. The global tariff does not apply to certain critical categories such as energy products, pharmaceuticals, and key agricultural goods, among others. In response, China's Ministry of Commerce has urged the U.S. to revoke unilateral tariff measures and refrain from imposing new ones, while expressing willingness to engage in candid consultations during the upcoming sixth round of economic and trade talks between the two countries. 5. Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, has been promoted from vice director of a department to the head of an undisclosed department at the ruling Workers' Party. According to North Korea's state-run Korea Central News Agency on Tuesday, the decision was made on Monday, the fifth day of the ninth Workers' Party Congress. Kim Yo-jong was also reinstated as an alternate member of the Politburo, the Party's highest policymaking body, after having been demoted to an ordinary Central Committee member five years ago. The KCNA also announced the five members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the regime's highest decision-making body when plenary meetings of the Party's Central Committee are not in session. Remarks by Kim Jong-un from Monday's meeting, where he said that no challenge or change in circumstances would be able to slow or stop the North's advance, were also reported. Moving to weather forecast, Most of the snow in central regions and Jeollabuk-do will let up tonight, while Jeollanam-do and Gyeongsang-do provinces could see a mix of rain and snow through tomorrow morning. By the afternoon, Seoul gets up to 15 degrees under sunnier skies, but southern regions will be cloudy with Busan and Jeju topping out at 14 degrees with decent air quality nationwide. Jeju is forecast to see more wet weather through the end of the week. 59:30’ The current temperatures are: _______ degrees in Seoul _______ degrees in Gwangju. _______ degrees in Busan And _______ degrees on Jejudo Island 59:39’ You’re listening to Arirang Radio 59:42’ 5880 2026-02-24 Podcast Play 19:55 Arirang News Welcome to Arirang News.

Recent data show that the government's efforts to tackle the heated real estate market seem to be working. According to the Bank of Korea, the Housing Price Outlook Consumer Sentiment Index plummeted to 108 in February. This is a massive 16-point drop from January’s 124. It reverses the months-long climb — from 119 in November and 121 in December — and marks the sharpest psychological cooling the nation has seen in years. The cooling follows after the government tried to, quote, "normalize" the real estate market. Regulators have effectively "locked" the market by choking off liquidity. Banks have been ordered to aggressively screen new mortgages, effectively banning loans for owners of multiple homes and tightening the debt-service ratio to unprecedented levels. And on Tuesday, the government passed a revision to the income tax enforcement decree as previously announced. From May 9th, the "grace period" for multi-home owners ends. The heavy capital gains tax, suspended for four years, will be fully reinstated. Sellers in adjustment areas will face punitive rates of up to 75 percent — rising to 82.5 percent with local taxes. While a short exception exists for contracts signed before the May deadline, the government has signaled this is the final warning. 3. Producer prices in South Korea rose for the fifth consecutive month in January, driven largely by semiconductors, agricultural produce, and financial services. According to the Bank of Korea this morning,.. the Producer Price Index stood at 1-hundred-22-point-5-0 last month, up 0-point-6 percent from December. Computer, electronic, and optical devices rose 1-point-8 percent. Notably, DRAM prices surged nearly 50 percent, while flash memory rose roughly 10 percent. Agricultural products saw a similar upward trend, led by sharp increases in fresh produce and livestock. Despite the rise, prices for the production of petroleum and diesel fell around 5-percent, bringing the overall average down. The central bank noted that consumer goods prices actually fell for the first time in eight months, suggesting the effect on consumer inflation remains to be seen. 4.

Remarks by Kim Jong-un from Monday's meeting, where he said that no challenge or change in circumstances would be able to slow or stop the North's advance, were also reported. No specific messages were issued regarding external policies toward South Korea or the U.S., as his remarks focused largely on domestic issues. 5. Moving to domestic issue, Former President Yoon Suk Yeol has appealed against the life sentence handed down in the first trial that found him guilty of leading an insurrection. His defense team filed... the appeal... to the Seoul Central District Court... earlier on this Tuesday. In a statement to the press the team said that it felt a strong sense of responsibility to raise concerns over the ruling both for the current court record and for future historical record... adding that the appeal aims... to address... what it described as... "errors"... in the ruling. Moving to weather forecast, After a prolonged stretch of very dry weather, rain and snow are finally arriving nationwide today, helping to ease the dryness. Precipitation is forecast to expand to most parts of the country by the afternoon. Until tomorrow, Jeju could see up to 80 millimeters of heavy rain, with Gyeongsang-do provinces getting 40 millimeters. But the capital area will see spotty rain. Then the inland southern regions could see a significant amount of snow. Western parts of Gyeongsang-do could get up to 10 centimeters of snow, with a chance of a heavy snow advisory being issued. And this afternoon, Seoul will get up to 6 degrees Celsius, Gwangju at 7 degrees. 59:30’ The current temperatures are: _______ degrees in Seoul _______ degrees in Gwangju. _______ degrees in Busan And _______ degrees on Jejudo Island 59:39’ You’re listening to Arirang Radio 59:42’ 5879 2026-02-24 Podcast Play 17:55 Arirang News Welcome to Arirang News.

President Lee Jae Myung welcomed Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to the Blue House on Monday with a warm embrace, reflecting their close personal rapport. Both leaders rose from humble beginnings, having worked as child laborers. Lula's three-day state visit, his first to South Korea in 21 years in what is his third term, began Sunday at Lee's invitation. The two leaders agreed to elevate South Korea and Brazil's almost seven-decade-long diplomatic ties to a Strategic Partnership and adopt a four-year action plan. Economic cooperation was at the center of the talks. Trade between the two countries has exceeded 10 billion U.S. dollars annually for the past five years, with Brazil serving as South Korea's largest trading partner and investment destination in South America. To continue this momentum, Lee and Lula reaffirmed the importance of striking a trade agreement between South Korea and the Mercosur bloc of South American countries. The summit was followed by the signing of 10 memorandums of understanding covering trade, technology, agriculture, and transnational crime. 3. South Korea has won a key round in its legal battle against U.S. hedge fund Elliott Investment Management over the 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates. The dispute stems from a 2023 ruling by the Netherlands-based Permanent Court of Arbitration ordering Seoul to pay 107-point-8 million dollars in damages and interest stemming from the controversial merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries. Elliott was a shareholder in Samsung C&T at the time of the 2015 merger. The government challenged the decision in London, arguing the tribunal lacked jurisdiction under the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement. Although Britain’s High Court initially dismissed the case, the Court of Appeal later sided with Seoul and sent it back for review. 4. Producer prices in South Korea rose for the fifth consecutive month in January, driven largely by semiconductors, agricultural produce, and financial services.

The central bank noted that consumer goods prices actually fell for the first time in eight months, suggesting the effect on consumer inflation remains to be seen. 5. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that countries attempting to "play games" with recent trade agreements could face even higher tariffs, following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down many of his sweeping global levies. Last week, the court blocked the bulk of tariffs Trump imposed under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, saying the law did not authorize the president to enact such measures. The ruling has created uncertainty worldwide, as governments reassess the status of trade deals negotiated in response to those tariffs. In response, Trump announced a new global tariff, initially set at 10 percent, but which he said would increase to 15 percent, using a different legal authority. The new measure, with some exemptions, is scheduled to take effect on Tuesday. The European Union suspended the ratification of a trade deal reached over the summer on Monday, while India announced it would postpone talks aimed at finalizing a recent agreement. On social media, Trump cautioned that any country seeking to use the court’s decision to retreat from prior commitments would face steeper tariffs than previously agreed. 6. Lastly to local bourse, South Korean stocks closed higher from the day before. Korea’s benchmark KOSPI gained 123 – point – 5 – 5 points to close at 5-thousand-9-hundred-69-point- 6 - 4 whereas KOSDAQ gained 13 – point – 0 – 1 points closing at 1-thousand-1-hundred-65-point-0-0 Moving to weather forecast, After a prolonged stretch of very dry weather, rain and snow are finally arriving nationwide today, helping to ease the dryness.

South Korea has won a key round in its legal battle against U.S. hedge fund Elliott Investment Management over the 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates. The dispute stems from a 2023 ruling by the Netherlands-based Permanent Court of Arbitration ordering Seoul to pay 107-point-8 million dollars in damages and interest stemming from the controversial merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries. Elliott was a shareholder in Samsung C&T at the time of the 2015 merger.

This is Key Kim. We start with the top headlines at this hour. 1. Speaking at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Lee praised Team Korea's determination and resilience. He also called for measures to make it easier for the public to watch such international sporting events, noting that this year's Olympics did not generate the level of nationwide excitement seen in the past. Lee's remarks appeared to refer to cable network JTBC's exclusive domestic broadcast of the Games. JTBC secured broadcast rights for the Olympics from 2026 through 2032 from the International Olympic Committee in 2019. However, negotiations to sublicense coverage to other Korean broadcasters ultimately collapsed, reportedly due to the high costs. 2. President Lee Jae Myung welcomed Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to the Blue House on Monday with a warm embrace, reflecting their close personal rapport. Both leaders rose from humble beginnings, having worked as child laborers. Lula's three-day state visit, his first to South Korea in 21 years in what is his third term, began Sunday at Lee's invitation. The two leaders agreed to elevate South Korea and Brazil's almost seven-decade-long diplomatic ties to a Strategic Partnership and adopt a four-year action plan.

This is Key Kim. We start with the top headlines at this hour. 1. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that countries attempting to "play games" with recent trade agreements could face even higher tariffs, following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down many of his sweeping global levies. Last week, the court blocked the bulk of tariffs Trump imposed under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, saying the law did not authorize the president to enact such measures. The ruling has created uncertainty worldwide, as governments reassess the status of trade deals negotiated in response to those tariffs. In response, Trump announced a new global tariff, initially set at 10 percent, but which he said would increase to 15 percent, using a different legal authority. The new measure, with some exemptions, is scheduled to take effect on Tuesday. The European Union suspended the ratification of a trade deal reached over the summer on Monday, while India announced it would postpone talks aimed at finalizing a recent agreement. Meanwhile, President Trump is set to deliver the first State of the Union address of his second term Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress. The annual speech will outline his budget priorities, assess the economy, and set out key domestic and foreign policy goals. The address comes at a politically sensitive moment, following the Supreme Court ruling and a recent shooting involving immigration enforcement officers in Minnesota. 2. Interim chief of Coupang Korea, Harold Rogers, appeared before the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday for a closed-door deposition, amid controversy over a massive data breach. Rogers testified for about seven hours before the House Judiciary Committee in Washington, in a session that could lead to follow-up legislative action. On his way to testify, Rogers declined to answer reporters' questions about what he would say during the session or whether he had any messages for Korean consumers. After the testimony, Coupang's parent company, Coupang Inc., released a statement expressing concern over the situation and said it is continuing efforts to seek a constructive resolution. 3.

Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong{이창용} said that South Korea's economy is set for a remarkable rebound this year, compared to 2025. Speaking at the National Assembly on Monday, Rhee noted that despite uncertainties concerning U.S. tariff policies, domestic demand is recovering on strong consumer sentiment and export growth fueled by the semiconductor boom. He said inflation will likely remain stable near the bank's 2 percent target; however, he pointed to international oil prices, exchange rate fluctuations, and stock market volatility as key risks. Rhee also warned of credit risks in vulnerable sectors, including self-employed businesses, amid ongoing concerns about financial imbalances from rising housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan area.
