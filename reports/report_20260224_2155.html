hour.\n\n1.\nPresident Lee Jae Myung has called for a faster legislation process in the face of a changing global order.\nSpeaking at a Cabinet meeting this morning, Lee said he sees it difficult to actively deal with changes in the global order with lawmaking \"at current speed.\" He added that South Korea is facing high global instability and fierce competition,... and called for national unity.\nThe president noted that the country is in dire need of laws to carry out trade deals with foreign nations and push ahead with regulatory reform.\n\n2.\nAlso on Tuesday, the Cabinet approved that highway tolls will be free of charge during the Lunar New Year holiday next week.\nToll fees will be exempt nationwide from February 15th to the 18th.\nThe temporary exemption is aimed at easing people's transportation cost burdens.\nThe transport ministry expects more than 27-million people to travel across the nation during the holiday.\n\n3.\nJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi thanked...\nPresident Lee Jae Myung... for his online post of congratulations on her party's recent victory in the Lower House snap election.\nOn Monday evening, the Japanese leader took to her social media platform to sincerely thank him both in Japanese and Korean.\nShe also wrote that Seoul and Tokyo are important neighbors... who must cooperate on the many challenges... facing the international community.\nShe further made note... of President Lee's visit to her home prefecture of Nara last month... adding hopes to visit South Korea in the near future.\n\n4.\nSouth Korea has finalized its medical school quota increase after a prolonged dispute since\n\n2024.\nThe government has put forth a five-year plan to increase medical school admissions starting from the 2027 academic year to address regional and public healthcare shortages.\nFollowing a meeting by the Health and Medical Policy Deliberation Committee on Tuesday, the Health Ministry says that enrollment will, on average, increase by 668 students per year from 2027 to 2031,... adding up to a total of 3,342 students over the next five years.\nThe government is emphasizing that it's a gradual increase to avoid strain on medical education.\nAll additional places will be allocated to 32 medical schools outside the capital region and will supplement the regional doctor track, which requires graduates to work in their hometown for 10 years in an effort to strengthen local and essential healthcare services.\nThe Ministry said it will provide full support through residency and regional settlement.\nCompared to the previous administration's plan to add 2-thousand students annually over five years starting in 2024, the scale of the current expansion has been reduced to roughly one-third of that.\nThe Korean Medical Association criticized the plan immediately during an emergency press conference.\nIt argued that the government's workforce projections lacked a basis.\n\n5.\nAccording to the Ministry of Science and ICT on Tuesday, the names and email addresses of\n\n33. 67 million users had been leaked from the company’s system, which is far more than the initially reported number of 4,\n\n500.\nOfficials warned that the actual number of victims could be even higher, as Coupang users often register delivery details for family members and acquaintances.\nAccording to the joint public-private investigation team, attackers gained access to Coupang’s servers by exploiting vulnerabilities in its authentication system, and were able to bypass normal security procedures by forging digital access passes.\nHowever, authorities did not officially disclose the identity of the suspect, and key details including the exact scale of the data leak with the Personal Information Protection Commission expected to release further findings at a later date.\nMeanwhile, the investigation team said no secondary damage resulting from the breach has been confirmed so far.\nAccording to the ministry, Coupang will be fined for its delayed reporting and placed under formal investigation for failing to preserve key evidence, despite earlier government requests.\nUnder South Korean law, such delays are punishable by fines of up to 30 million won, or approximately 20 thousand U.S. dollars.\nMoving to weather forecast, In the mountainous areas of Jejudo Island, where a heavy snow advisory has been issued, everything is already covered in fresh white snow.\nUntil tomorrow morning, about 5 to 15 millimeters of rain is expected.\nIn colder areas, that rain will likely turn into snow.\nIn the meantime, eastern areas will not get much precipitation, so dry conditions will continue.\nMost areas will start off above freezing temperatures with Seoul and Gwangju at 1 degree. 59:30’ The current temperatures are: _______ degrees in Seoul _______ degrees in Pyeongchang _______ degrees in Busan And _______ degrees on Jejudo Island 59:39’ You’re listening to Arirang Radio 59:42’ 5883 2026-02-25 Podcast Play 13:55 Arirang News Welcome to Arirang News This is Park Kee hoon And we start with the top headlines at this hour.\n\n1.\nSouth Korea’s benchmark KOSPI opened higher Wednesday, breaking new historic landmark of 6,000 amid an extended rally in technology stocks.\nThe KOSPI opened at 6-thousand-22-point-7-0, up 53-point-0-6 points, or 0-point-8-9 percent, from the previous day.\nOn Tuesday, Samsung Electronics and SK hynix closed above the 200,000 won and 1 million won marks, respectively, pushing up the index.\n\n2.\nSouth Korean Ambassador to the United States Kang Kyung-wha says Seoul will actively work with Washington to ensure trade discussions proceed in a \"friendly atmosphere.\" Speaking to correspondents in Washington on Tuesday local time, Kang addressed the aftermath of the U.S.\nSupreme Court’s ruling that declared reciprocal tariffs illegal, and the Trump administration's subsequent move to levy new global tariffs.\nShe emphasized that the embassy is closely monitoring the Trump administration's follow-up measures including additional tariffs to protect South Korean interests.\nOn the security front, Seoul and Washington are continuing discussions on implementing their \"Joint Fact Sheet,\" which covers cooperation on nuclear-powered submarines and nuclear energy.\n\n3.\nThe Commander of U.S.\nForces Korea has expressed regret to Seoul's Defense Minister for not briefing him promptly on recent air drills over the Yellow Sea.\nIn a statement Tuesday, General Xavier Brunson said he spoke with Minister Ahn Gyu-back to clarify that notification was provided at a working level, but regretted that the Minister and the JCS Chairman were not briefed in time.\nThis follows a rare standoff last week when Chinese fighter jets were dispatched in response to some 10 USFK F-16s flying between the air defense identification zones of South Korea and China.\nFollowing a complaint from Seoul about the lack of advance notice, the U.S. military ended the exercise on Thursday, two days earlier than planned.\nLocal media reported that USFK apologized for the incident, but USFK denied the report, emphasizing it does not make apologies for maintaining readiness.\n\n4.\nThe White House says diplomacy is President Donald Trump's first option in dealing with Iran, but stressed that he's prepared to use lethal military force if necessary.\nAccording to the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday, President Trump is the final decision maker and will act if talks fail.\nThe U.S. has deployed significant naval forces near Iran’s coast, as Trump last week gave Tehran roughly 10 to 15 days to reach a deal.\nMeanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to brief congressional leaders known as the Gang of Eight at the White House on the Iran situation.\n\n5.\nSouth Korea’s National Assembly is heading into what could be its longest plenary session, after an opposition-led filibuster was triggered by a series of controversial bills backed by the ruling party.\nDuring Tuesday's session, lawmakers first voted to approve the arrest of former Democratic Party lawmaker Kang Sun-woo, who is accused of accepting illegal campaign donations.\nThe ruling party then introduced revisions to the Commercial Act, along with three judicial reform bills that would expand the Supreme Court, establish a new appeals system, and penalize officials accused of distorting legal rulings.\nAs soon as the revision to the Commercial Act was reported to the floor, the People Power Party launched a filibuster with eight bills remaining on the agenda. 5882 2026-02-25 Podcast Play 10:55 Arirang News Welcome to Arirang News This is Park Kee hoon And we start with the top headlines at this

Russia said Tuesday that it will continue fighting until it fully achieves its objectives.\nMoscow maintains it's open to a peaceful resolution, but insists any progress depends entirely on Kyiv’s actions.\nThe Kremlin is again demanding that Ukraine give up the Donbas region, making clear there will be no compromise on territorial issues.\nPresident Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of obstructing peace negotiations and warned there would be consequences for any nuclear strike against Russia.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pushed back, saying Ukraine has defended its independence for four years and that Putin has failed to win the war.\nHe also urged Europe to step up pressure on Russia. 5881 2026-02-24 Podcast Play 21:55 Arirang News Welcome to Arirang News.\nThis is Key Kim.\nWe start with the top headlines at this hour.\n\n1.\nSpeaking at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Lee praised Team Korea's determination and resilience.\nHe also called for measures to make it easier for the public to watch such international sporting events, noting that this year's Olympics did not generate the level of nationwide excitement seen in the past.\nLee's remarks appeared to refer to cable network JTBC's exclusive domestic broadcast of the Games.\nJTBC secured broadcast rights for the Olympics from 2026 through 2032 from the International Olympic Committee in\n\n2019.\nHowever, negotiations to sublicense coverage to other Korean broadcasters ultimately collapsed, reportedly due to the high costs.\n\n2.\nSouth Korea’s National Assembly is heading into what could be its longest plenary session, after an opposition-led filibuster was triggered by a series of controversial bills backed by the ruling party.\nDuring Tuesday's session, lawmakers first voted to approve the arrest of former Democratic Party lawmaker Kang Sun-woo, who is accused of accepting illegal campaign donations.\nThe ruling party then introduced revisions to the Commercial Act, along with three judicial reform bills that would expand the Supreme Court, establish a new appeals system, and penalize officials accused of distorting legal rulings.\nAs soon as the revision to the Commercial Act was reported to the floor, the People Power Party launched a filibuster --- with eight bills remaining on the agenda.\nThe plenary session came just hours after the Legislation and Judiciary Committee approved a special act on administrative integration for Jeollanam-do Province and Gwangju, led by the ruling Democratic Party.\nThe selective passage drew sharp criticism from the People Power Party, which said it does not oppose administrative integration in principle but accused the ruling party of fast-tracking bills for politically favorable regions without clear standards, including fiscal support.\nThe Democratic Party pushed back, accusing the opposition of holding the bills hostage through filibusters and blocking regional development, while parliamentary rules mean only one bill can be processed per day due to the 24-hour waiting period to end debate.\n\n3.\nPresidential chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik has departed for the UAE to discuss cooperation on AI and the defense industry.\nHe's set to discuss follow-ups to last year's summit between President Lee Jae Myung and his UAE counterpart Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\nThe two countries are reportedly looking for a possible joint development of a weapons system to expand arms cooperation beyond exports.\nIt's Kang's third visit to Abu Dhabi as a special presidential envoy for strategic economic cooperation.\n\n4.\nStarting at 12:01 AM Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time, U.S.\nPresident Donald Trump's new \"global tariff\" officially took effect at a 10 percent rate on most imports from around the world.\nThis is 5 percentage points below the 15 percent rate President Trump announced over the weekend for all trading partners.\nFollowing a proclamation signed late last week under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, the provision authorizes the president to impose temporary surcharges of up to 15 percent for a maximum of 150 days to address serious U.S. trade deficits or balance of payments imbalances, without prior approval from Congress.\nTrump's move came as a direct response to last Friday's Supreme Court decision, which struck down many of his earlier \"reciprocal\" and country-specific tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, ruling that the president had exceeded his authority.\nJust hours before the imposition of 15 percent tariff, U.S.\nCustoms and Border Protection issued guidance to importers confirming the initial 10 percent rate applies for now.\nThe global tariff does not apply to certain critical categories such as energy products, pharmaceuticals, and key agricultural goods, among others.\nIn response, China's Ministry of Commerce has urged the U.S. to revoke unilateral tariff measures and refrain from imposing new ones, while expressing willingness to engage in candid consultations during the upcoming sixth round of economic and trade talks between the two countries.\n\n5.\nKim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, has been promoted from vice director of a department to the head of an undisclosed department at the ruling Workers' Party.\nAccording to North Korea's state-run Korea Central News Agency on Tuesday, the decision was made on Monday, the fifth day of the ninth Workers' Party Congress.\nKim Yo-jong was also reinstated as an alternate member of the Politburo, the Party's highest policymaking body, after having been demoted to an ordinary Central Committee member five years ago.\nThe KCNA also announced the five members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the regime's highest decision-making body when plenary meetings of the Party's Central Committee are not in session.\nRemarks by Kim Jong-un from Monday's meeting, where he said that no challenge or change in circumstances would be able to slow or stop the North's advance, were also reported.\nMoving to weather forecast, Most of the snow in central regions and Jeollabuk-do will let up tonight, while Jeollanam-do and Gyeongsang-do provinces could see a mix of rain and snow through tomorrow morning.\nBy the afternoon, Seoul gets up to 15 degrees under sunnier skies, but

generate the level of nationwide excitement seen in the past.\nLee's remarks appeared to refer to cable network JTBC's exclusive domestic broadcast of the Games.\nJTBC secured broadcast rights for the Olympics from 2026 through 2032 from the International Olympic Committee in\n\n2019.\nHowever, negotiations to sublicense coverage to other Korean broadcasters ultimately collapsed, reportedly due to the high costs.\n\n2.\nRecent data show that the government's efforts to tackle the heated real estate market seem to be working.\nAccording to the Bank of Korea, the Housing Price Outlook Consumer Sentiment Index plummeted to 108 in February.\nThis is a massive 16-point drop from January’s\n\n124.\nIt reverses the months-long climb — from 119 in November and 121 in December — and marks the sharpest psychological cooling the nation has seen in years.\nThe cooling follows after the government tried to, quote, \"normalize\" the real estate market.\nRegulators have effectively \"locked\" the market by choking off liquidity.\nBanks have been ordered to aggressively screen new mortgages, effectively banning loans for owners of multiple homes and tightening the debt-service ratio to unprecedented levels.\nAnd on Tuesday, the government passed a revision to the income tax enforcement decree as previously announced.\nFrom May 9th, the \"grace period\" for multi-home owners ends.\nThe heavy capital gains tax, suspended for four years, will be fully reinstated.\nSellers in adjustment areas will face punitive rates of up to 75 percent — rising to\n\n82. 5 percent with local taxes.\nWhile a short exception exists for contracts signed before the May deadline, the government has signaled this is the final warning.\n\n3.\nProducer prices in South Korea rose for the fifth consecutive month in January, driven largely by semiconductors, agricultural produce, and financial services.\nAccording to the Bank of Korea this morning,.. the Producer Price Index stood at

Sunday at Lee's invitation.\nThe two leaders agreed to elevate South Korea and Brazil's almost seven-decade-long diplomatic ties to a Strategic Partnership and adopt a four-year action plan.\nEconomic cooperation was at the center of the talks.\nTrade between the two countries has exceeded 10 billion U.S. dollars annually for the past five years, with Brazil serving as South Korea's largest trading partner and investment destination in South America.\nTo continue this momentum, Lee and Lula reaffirmed the importance of striking a trade agreement between South Korea and the Mercosur bloc of South

Samsung C&T at the time of the 2015 merger.\nThe government challenged the decision in London, arguing the tribunal lacked jurisdiction under the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement.\nAlthough Britain’s

that struck down many of his sweeping global levies.\nLast week, the court blocked the bulk of tariffs Trump imposed under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, saying the law did not authorize the president to enact such measures.\nThe ruling has created uncertainty worldwide, as governments reassess the status of trade deals negotiated in response to those tariffs.\nIn response, Trump announced a new global tariff, initially set at 10 percent, but which he said would increase to 15 percent, using a different legal authority.\nThe new measure, with some exemptions, is scheduled to take effect on Tuesday.\nThe European Union suspended the ratification of a trade deal reached over the summer on Monday, while India announced it would postpone talks aimed at finalizing a recent agreement.\nOn social media, Trump cautioned that any country seeking to use the court’s decision to retreat from prior commitments would face steeper tariffs than previously agreed.\n\n6.\nLastly to local bourse, South Korean stocks closed higher from the day before.\nKorea’s benchmark KOSPI gained 123 – point – 5 – 5 points to close at 5-thousand-9-hundred-69-point- 6 -

case, the Court of Appeal later sided with Seoul and sent it back for review.\n\n4.\nKim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, has been promoted from vice director of a department to the head of an undisclosed department at the ruling Workers' Party.\nAccording to North Korea's state-run Korea Central News Agency on Tuesday, the decision was made on Monday, the fifth day of the ninth Workers' Party Congress.\nKim Yo-jong was also reinstated as an alternate member of the Politburo, the Party's highest policymaking body, after having been demoted to an ordinary Central Committee member five years ago.\nThe KCNA also announced the five members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the regime's highest decision-making body when plenary meetings of the Party's Central Committee are not in session.\nRemarks by Kim Jong-un from Monday's meeting, where he said that no challenge or change in circumstances would be able to slow or stop the North's advance, were also reported.\nNo specific messages were issued regarding external policies toward South Korea or the U.S., as his remarks focused largely on domestic issues.\n\n5.\nBank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong{이창용} said that South Korea's economy is set for a remarkable rebound this year, compared to\n\n2025.\nSpeaking at the National Assembly on Monday, Rhee noted that despite uncertainties concerning U.S. tariff policies, domestic demand is recovering on strong consumer sentiment and export growth fueled by the semiconductor boom.\nHe said inflation will likely remain stable near the bank's 2 percent target; however, he pointed to international oil prices, exchange rate fluctuations, and stock market volatility as key risks.\nRhee also warned of credit risks in vulnerable sectors, including self-employed businesses, amid ongoing concerns about financial imbalances from rising housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan area.\nMoving to weather forecast, After a prolonged stretch of very dry weather, rain and snow are finally arriving nationwide today, helping to ease the dryness.\nPrecipitation is forecast to expand to most parts of the country by the afternoon.\nUntil tomorrow, Jeju could see up to 80 millimeters of heavy rain, with Gyeongsang-do provinces getting 40 millimeters.\nBut the capital area will see spotty rain.\nThen the inland southern regions could see a significant amount of snow.\nWestern parts of Gyeongsang-do could get up to 10 centimeters of snow, with a chance of a heavy snow advisory being issued.\nAnd this afternoon, Seoul will get up to 6 degrees Celsius, Gwangju at 7 degrees. 59:30’ The current temperatures are: _______ degrees in Seoul _______ degrees in Gwangju. _______ degrees in Busan And _______ degrees on Jejudo Island 59:39’
